# Next.js 15 Upgrade & E2E Test Fixes - Complete Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All issues have been successfully resolved. Next.js 15 upgrade completed with zero vulnerabilities, and E2E test infrastructure is now ready for CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 1. Next.js 15 Upgrade

### Versions Updated

- **Next.js**: 14.2.33 → 15.5.6
- **eslint-config-next**: 14.2.33 → 15.5.6
- **ESLint**: 8.57.1 → 9.9.0

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. next.config.mjs

**Before:**

```javascript
experimental: {
  serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['@prisma/client', 'bcrypt'],
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
serverExternalPackages: ['@prisma/client', 'bcrypt'],
```

**Reason:** Next.js 15 moved this API from experimental to stable

#### 2. components/product-grid.tsx

**Issue:** ESLint strict rule violation - using `<a>` instead of `<Link>`

**Fix:**

```tsx
// Added Link import
import Link from 'next/link';

// Replaced <a> with <Link>
<Link href="/products" className="...">
  View All Products
</Link>;
```

#### 3. server/actions/cart.ts

**Issue:** `cookies()` now returns a Promise in Next.js 15

**Before:**

```typescript
const cookieStore = cookies();
let sessionId = cookieStore.get('cart-session')?.value;
```

**After:**

```typescript
const cookieStore = await cookies();
let sessionId = cookieStore.get('cart-session')?.value;
```

### Vulnerabilities Status

- **Before:** 3 high-severity vulnerabilities (glob transitive from eslint-config-next@14)
- **After:** 0 vulnerabilities
- **npm audit result:** `found 0 vulnerabilities`

**Why Fixed:** Next.js 15 uses newer versions of internal dependencies that don't have the glob vulnerability

## 2. Database Migration Setup

### Issue

E2E tests were failing with:

```text
❌ Error seeding database: PrismaClientKnownRequestError:
Invalid `prisma.user.upsert()` invocation
The table `public.users` does not exist in the current database.
```

### Root Cause

- No Prisma migrations folder existed
- `prisma migrate deploy` requires migrations to exist
- Database tables were never created

### Solution

Created complete Prisma migration structure:

- `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` - Initial schema SQL
- `prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml` - Prisma lock file

### Migration Includes

- ✅ All 12 tables (users, products, orders, categories, etc.)
- ✅ All enums (UserRole, OrderStatus, ProductStatus)
- ✅ All foreign keys and relationships
- ✅ All unique constraints and indexes
- ✅ Proper cascade delete policies

### Verified Commands in CI

```bash
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma migrate deploy # Apply migrations
npx prisma db seed       # Seed test data
```

## 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

### E2E Test Configuration Update

**Before:**

```yaml
- name: Start application
  run: |
    npm start &
    npx wait-on http://localhost:3000

- name: Run Cypress E2E tests
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
  with:
    start: npm start
    wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
    wait-on-timeout: 120
    browser: chrome
    record: true
    parallel: true
  env:
    CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

**After:**

```yaml
- name: Run Cypress E2E tests
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
  with:
    build: npm run build
    start: npm start
    wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
    wait-on-timeout: 120
    browser: chrome
    record: false
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Eliminated duplicate "Start application" step
- ✅ Cypress action properly manages server lifecycle
- ✅ Disabled Cloud recording (no CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY needed)
- ✅ Better control over build step
- ✅ Cleaner workflow without race conditions

### Security Scanning Update

```yaml
- name: Run npm audit
  # Next.js 15+ fixes all glob vulnerabilities
  # No critical or high severity vulnerabilities remain
  run: npm audit --audit-level moderate
```

Changed from `critical` to `moderate` level since no vulnerabilities exist now.
